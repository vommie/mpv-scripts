-- This script enables a "hold to fast-play" feature in MPV (similar to YouTube). When the left mouse button (MBTN_LEFT) is held down for a specified duration, the playback speed increases to a user-defined fast speed. Releasing the button returns the speed to the previous speed.
--
-- Keybinding: "MBTN_LEFT" (left mouse button) triggers the fast-play feature. Change the last line to another key or mouse button (e.g., "f", "SPACE", "MBTN_RIGHT") if desired.

-- This script was inspired and based on https://github.com/Ciacconas/mpv-scripts/blob/master/hold_accelerate.lua
